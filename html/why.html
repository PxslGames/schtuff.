        <h1>Why does Schtuff exist?</h1> <!-- Big centered text -->
        
        <p>
            Schtuff exists for two main reasons:
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>1. To create a cool and enjoyable website for everyone</strong></p>
        <p>
            I wanted to build something fun that anyone could enjoy. A place full of random and quirky things to explore. 
            This website is meant to be a place where you can discover little weird creations, big or small, all in one place!
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>2. To gather all my "micro-websites" in one place</strong></p>
        <p>
            I have way too many ideas for small web projects, like a username generator or a random quiz. These ideas are often too small 
            to stand on their own as full websites. So, I thought, "Why not just merge them all into one place?" That's where Schtuff comes in!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That’s also why Schtuff is so random — whatever silly, funny, or cool ideas for web projects I get, I just throw them here! 
            It’s a little chaotic, but that’s the fun of it!
        </p>

        <p>
            I really hope you like my website and enjoy the randomness! Thanks for visiting!
        </p>
